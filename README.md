CS 445 Computational Photography - Final project 

Part 1:
The project captures user's portrait image from the webcam using face detection.
It automatically converts the captured image into a cartoonized image.
As the image is converted it will be saved for each step in the pipeline of the converting process.

You can run this by downloading the repository and running the capture.py file by using the command

"python capture.py"

To capture the screen you can hit "ctrl + c" on the command line to terminate the program and it will capture
the image and convert as the program terminates.
The captured and converted images will be saved in the same directory.


Part2:

You can run this by downloading the repository and running the cartoonizer.py file by using the command

"python cartoonizer.py captured.jpg cartoonized.jpg"
